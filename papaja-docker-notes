# The idea is that I will understand, and explain clearly, each line

# Ubuntu 18.04 has some `devtools` available as a binary.
# This reduces installation time and headaches.
# `devtools` is necessary for installing an R package from GitHub.
# `curl` and `gdebi-core` are needed for Rstudio server.
# `texlive-*`, `pandoc`, & `lmodern` are needed for papaja
#  texlive-full is huge so I add just the necessary utilities
# 'noninteractive' frontend prevents R from pausing installation to ask about TZ
# 'RSTUDIO_VERSION' may need to be updated as new versions come out.
